# Challenge-01
## Description
The objective of this project was for us to get used to being able to read CSS as well as HTML and figure out what the code does and also how to simplify the code so that all the functions still work. This is the first challenge project of the bootcamp where we are given an almost ready to go code and were asked to look over to see discrepancies and given guidelines of how we can make the code better. At the end of this project, we will start to have an idea of the code that goes into building a website and what it looks like. 

This is the link to the website: https://chewytaro.github.io/Challenge-01/

This is screenshots of what the website looks like:

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
This website holds an almost ready to go code, however, there are certain areas that are purposefully overcomplicated and confusing for us to look over and simplify. When inspecting the code of the page we can now see that there is a concise title to the page, added alternative ids to the images as well as simplification of the overall HTML and CSS codes so that it is easier for others to read.
